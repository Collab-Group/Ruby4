# Ruby4
Ruby4 is a hobbyist operating system, using the foundation of MOOS with my ideas and code built on top of it.

Ruby4 encourages exploration and experimentation with its user friendly source code, with it's kernel and applications being written purely in C# using MOOS and [CMOOS](https://github.com/avalontm/CMOOS).

# Compiling Ruby 4
Ruby4 and MOOS both use NativeAOT to convert highier level programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C# and Java into machine language. Most of Ruby4 is made with C# therefore we use NativeAOT as a tool to convert this code to machine language, this is what makes Ruby4 what it is. To get started with compiling Ruby4 please refer to our Wiki, where everything you need to know about Ruby4 will be stored, e.g file systems, compiling, power management and etc.

# Ruby4
Ruby4 is a hobbyist operating system, using the foundation of MOOS with my ideas and code built on top of it.

Ruby4 encourages exploration and experimentation with its user friendly source code, with it's kernel and applications being written purely in C# using MOOS and [CMOOS](https://github.com/avalontm/CMOOS).

# Ruby4
Ruby4 is a hobbyist operating system, using certain elements of MOSA with my ideas and code built on top of it.

Ruby4 encourages exploration and experimentation with its not-so user friendly source code, with it's kernel and applications being written purely in C#.

# Requirements
In order to compile Ruby4 you'll need Visual Studio 2019 with the .NET Desktop Development and Desktop Development with C++ workloads.

Ruby4 requires .NET [5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) & [8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (both x64/86), alongside [MOSA-Core](https://github.com/Collab-Group/mosa-core/) to be setup and installed in Program Files. 

These dependencies are automatically installed however if you use the Ruby4 bootstrap script, simply run `ruby4.bat` and it will take care of everything required to get up and running.
